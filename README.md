## Reference Name Search
Type the reference name to immediatly see the color and its RGB values. Type in capital or lowercase, with our without spaces.

## Find closest color
You have an RGB and you're looking for the best Pantone color match? Type your RGB value and immediately see the best match. Separate each value with spaces or commas.


## Averaging Colors
You might have noticed, selecting a single color in Pantone's catalog matching the color you want to identify is nearly impossible. So, why selecting only one color? Instead, select as many colors as you think close enough to the color you want to identify and type their references to Pantone Color Picker Averaging. The app will average the RGB values of your selected colors and give you the best match.
